Rules of Survival - Apocalypse 

Setup: The year is 2054. SCAMlabs is close to discovering a means to live forever, 
through the means of harnessing and controlling time energy. Of course, as fate would have it, a terrible accident happens in the lab, 
spilling the time energy into the air. The energy quickly spreads in all directions, messing with the natural order of humanity.
SCAMlab employees fall over dead, and the dead begin to come to life, but with bodies that have decayed.
As far as YOU, an employee of SCAMlabs, can tell, are the last remaining survivor of the time crisis. Packed with a heavy assult rifle,
you are now the only thing in between the living and the inevitable take over of the undead.

Rules are simple: Survive against waves of approaching zombies for as long as possible
Map: Inside SCAMlabs, multiple rooms including an aircraft carrier.
Controls: AWSD or arrows for movement, curser and mouseclick to aim and fire weapon, spacebar to jump
